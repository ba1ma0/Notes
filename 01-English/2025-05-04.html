  <h1>Welcome to the Safari Listen to Page Demo测试,这是一个测试 Do you Member </h1>
  
  <p>This is a simple page where Safari can listen to the content and read it aloud when selected.</p>
  
  <p>To test this feature, select the text on this page and choose "Speak" from the context menu. Safari will read the text aloud to you. You can also control the speaking rate and voice settings in the iOS settings under "Accessibility" -> "Spoken Content" -> "Speech Rate".</p>
  
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  
  <p>This is how you can make your webpage content accessible to Safari's "Listen to Page" feature.</p>
  
  <h3>Additional Information</h3>
  <p>Safari's built-in "Listen to Page" works by recognizing and reading the text that is part of the page's HTML content. It can read paragraphs, headings, and other text elements.</p>

  <h4>Tips for Better Experience:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the text is well-structured using proper HTML elements.</li>
    <li>Enable "Speak Selection" in the iOS settings.</li>
    <li>Test on an iPhone or iPad with VoiceOver or "Speak Selection" enabled.</li>
  </ul>
